# Data Info API (Operators)

## This Document
This document will detail a route to implement the Data Info API on the Operator side. This will look at issues, likely questions, a brief architecture and other related items.

## API
APIs needed are listed below.

### Type Of API
Browser could happen, but device api is easier

### APIs Needed
Three APIs will be needed:
* web apis
* device api
* carrier api

## Issues
Brain dump of issues, need to clean this up:

### Delays
5 mins delay common

### Data Plan Cases
* Roaming
 * could be more instantaneous if you’re roaming
 * roaming use case - depends on the foreign carrier, some up to date, some just get a CSV 3 days later
 * international roaming versus US roaming
* Pre pay 
* Shared Data Plans
* Unlimited data
* Zero-Rating

### Bill shock(!)
Need to make sure the user’s bill then matches the costs which are showing on their device as an outcome of the Data Info API. 

### Authenticate the customer against the device 
How do we do this?
oath could work
sms could also work
silent sms on ffos

### Legal
FCC rules - need to check this

### Typical Questions Operators will Receive
* How does Authentication work?
* Sharing data - do we want this?
